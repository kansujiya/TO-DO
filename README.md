# TO-DO
TO-DO Task Project using Core Data

Contains a tab bar with two tabs: “pending” and “done”.

• Each tab shows a table view with the list of tasks in that state.

• Allows the user to create a new task by tapping on a "+" button in the navigation

bar (only in the “pending” tab). The user can then enter a name for the task. You

can do this either on the same screen or on a separate screen.

• Allows the user to delete a task by swiping it right to lef

• Allows the user to change a task's state to “done” or “pending” by simply

tapping on it. Once the user tapped on a task, a “Cancel” button should appear

over the cell for five seconds, allowing the user to stop the operation. If the

button is not pressed, the task transitions its state and appears on the other tab.

(Think of it as similar to the Gmail feature to “Undo” a deleted message)

Please keep the following in mind:

• Retrieving the tasks from the network should be done on the background,

showing a “loading indicator” while the operation is performed.

• You are allowed to use open source projects that simplify your work.
